Welcome to Hipopy's documentation!
===================================

**Hipopy** is a Python library for reading `CLAS12 HIPO <https://github.com/gavalian/hipo>`_ files directly
into `Awkward <https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ arrays.
It uses `hipopybind <https://github.com/mfmceneaney/hipopybind>`_ and `PyBind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_ 
to import classes from C++ HIPO libraries into python
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API similar to `UpROOT <https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
