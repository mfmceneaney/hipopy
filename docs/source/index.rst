Welcome to Hipopy's documentation!
===================================

**Hipopy** is a Python library for reading `CLAS12 HIPO <https://github.com/gavalian/hipo>`_ files directly
into `Awkward <https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ arrays.
It uses ctypes bound python functions to interface with the C++ HIPO libraries
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API similar to `UpROOT <https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
